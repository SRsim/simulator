/* Bus class
 * Brendan Tauras 2009-04-06
 *
 * Multi-channel bus comprised of Channel class objects
 * Simulates control and data delays by allowing variable channel lock
 * durations.  The sender (controller class) should specify the delay (control,
 * data, or both) for events (i.e. read = ctrl, ctrl+data; write = ctrl+data;
 * erase or merge = ctrl).  The hardware enable signals are implicitly
 * simulated by the sender locking the appropriate bus channel through the lock
 * method, then sending to multiple devices by calling the appropriate method
 * in the Package class. */
